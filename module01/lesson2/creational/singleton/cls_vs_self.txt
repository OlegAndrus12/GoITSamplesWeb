According to PEP 8: 
Function and method arguments:

Always use self for the first argument to instance methods.

Always use cls for the first argument to class methods.

The main difference beetwen cls and self is that
cls refers to the class, 
whereas self refers to the instance. 
Using the cls keyword, we can only access the members of the class, 
whereas using the self keyword, we can access both the instance variables and the class attributes. 
With cls, we cannot access the instance variables in a class
